Codes for assignments done as part of EE522-Matrix Theory

## Problems

-  Matrix multiplication using approaches mentioned below:
   - dot product of rows and columns (the most commonly used approach)
   - matrix-vector multiplication (this uses dot product internally) (column way)
   - vector-matrix multiplication (this also uses dot product internally) (row way)
   - cross product of columns and rows (column-row way)
   - block matrix multiplication (recursive)
   
-  Implement Gauss-Jordan algorithm. Reduce a matrix to Echelon and RREF using Gauss-Jordan algorithm.

-  Write a program that finds determinant of a matrix:
   - using a recursive routine and 
   - reducing the matrix to upper triangular matrix using Gauss-Jordan elimination.
